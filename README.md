# The Timber Starter Theme with Webpack

The "_s" for Timber: a dead-simple theme that you can build from. Now with Webpack!

## Installing the Theme

Install this theme as you would any other, and be sure the Timber plugin is activated. But hey, let's break it down into some bullets:

1. Make sure you have installed the plugin for the [Timber Library](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/) (and Advanced Custom Fields - they [play quite nicely](http://timber.github.io/timber/#acf-cookbook) together). 
2. Download the zip for this theme (or clone it) and move it to `wp-content/themes` in your WordPress installation. 
3. Rename the folder to something that makes sense for your website (generally no spaces and all lowercase). You could keep the name `timber-starter-theme` but the point of a starter theme is to make it your own!
4. Activate the theme in Appearance >  Themes.
5. Install and build frontend dependencies by navigating to theme folder and running `npm install && npx webpack -w`
6. Do your thing! And read [the docs](https://github.com/jarednova/timber/wiki).

## Building for production

Run `cd wp-content/themes/my-theme/ && npm install && npx webpack -p` to build minified files for production.

## What's here?

`src/templates/` contains all of your Twig templates. These pretty much correspond 1 to 1 with the PHP files that respond to the WordPress template hierarchy. At the end of each PHP template, you'll notice a `Timber::render()` function whose first parameter is the Twig file where that data (or `$context`) will be used. Just an FYI.

`bin/` and `tests/` ... basically don't worry about (or remove) these unless you know what they are and want to.
